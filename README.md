# MAGIC!
<pre>
Hello, and welcome to the wonderful world of MAGIC!
To play the current build of this game, a mouse and keyboard are required, but
gamepad usage for gameplay is supported. Gamepads should be plugged in before
pressing "Start Game" from the Main Menu.

If no input devices are selected for either player, only one player character
will spawn, which will be controlled by keyboard controls. If the same input
device is selected for both players, two player characters will spawn, and
will both be controlled by that input device. If at least two input devices
are plugged in and different ones are selected for each player, then two
player characters will spawn, each controlled by a different input device.


MAGIC! is a PvE wave-survival game. You lose when the health of both player characters
is depleted, and you win when you've destroyed every wave of enemies that dares to
approach you.

NOTES:
 -There are multiple spells in the game that cause a "stun" debuff for enemies hit, which means that
  it will keep the enemies at bay for the duration of the stun.
 -There are instances where the enemies don't recognize the wall/borders.
 -The player cube can "hide" under the pine trees and make the enemies unable to reach them.
