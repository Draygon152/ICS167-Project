Hello, and welcome to the wonderful world of MAGIC!
To play the current build of this game, a mouse and keyboard are required.

MAGIC! is a PvE wave-survival game. You lose when your health is depleted, and
you win when you've destroyed every wave of enemies that dares to approach you.

CONTROLS:
  MENU NAVIGATION:
    - Move the mouse and left-click on buttons!
    
  PLAYER:
    - W, A, S, D for movement
    - Press Q to fire a spell in the direction the player is facing
    
NOTES:
  In the first-playtest build of the game, the submenus within the Options menu
  have not yet been implemented. In addition to this, while there is a menu selection
  area for a second player to enter the game, there is not yet support for cooperative
  play. Extra effects for many spells are still a work in progress, though wind and
  lightning bonus spell effects have been partially implemented and the base stats
  of all spells are different. For the first playtest, players may only challenge
  two waves of enemies.
