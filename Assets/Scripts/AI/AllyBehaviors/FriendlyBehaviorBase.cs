// Note to the professor and TAs:
// The purpose of this class is to be able to expand 
// into different friendly AIs, like ally npcs or
// neutral creatures wandering around the map
// We don't have time for an friendly AI other than the
// AI player, so this class is a bit bare
// It is structured like this only to leave the door
// open to future possibilities in case we come back
// to this game in the summer
